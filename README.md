# hello-world
This is my first repository, I'm still not sure what that means. Is it a master folder? Does it contain folders/files or branches as well? Are branches different from repositories, if so how?
Okay, so I think a repository is a project file which initially contains only one branch, to add features to this project, you create new feature branches and when you're done with 'em, you either merge them with the master branch or delete them.
